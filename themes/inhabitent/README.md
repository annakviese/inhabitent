## Inhabitent Theme
![Alt text](https://github.com/annakviese/inhabitent/blob/master/themes/inhabitent/documentation/inhabitent.png)

#### About 
This is my first custom Wordpress Theme. This is a theme for a outdoor recreation company "Inhabitent Inc". 
The theme required multiple pages with different content styles. 
As it was the first custom theme I've built, this task presented multiple challenges: from figuring out the styling options
for different pages and content types to building out custom widgets, custom archive and taxonomy pages. 

The theme required a lot of styling and positioning and it was great opportunity to practice CSS and SCSS.
The theme also included some animation for the search bar, different colors for navigation bar and gradient for most of the images.  

The more I was working on this project, the more I've felt that there are so many opportunities to improve and make the code much cleaner and simpler. 

#### Technology Used

* HTML / HTML5
* CSS / CSS3
* PHP
* SASS 
* JQuery 

#### Improvements 

* Correct all the errors and warnings displayed by Theme Checker
* Adjust some of the styles to be readable by Mozilla & IE
* Great addition would be to make the theme responsive
* Create more variable and mixins in scss and rename the existing ones
* Add a working shopping cart
